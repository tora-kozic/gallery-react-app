# gallery-react-app
Gallery and e-commerce app built using React and Bootstrap.

### To run:
To start the local node server on port 3000:
```
  npm start
```
To start the json-server that provides basic backend functionality - database querying and user authentication:
```
  ./node_modules/.bin/json-server-auth ./backend/db.json --port 3001
```

## Project Description
Started this project to help me improve my frontened development skills using React with Bootstrap styling.  The app is intended to eventually become a personal art portfolio/gallery website with an online print shop.

### Prototype
The desktop application was mocked-up using [invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/).
